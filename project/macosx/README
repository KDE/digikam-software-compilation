DESCRIPTION
-----------
These files and scripts are used to make binary packages of the digiKam
Software Collection for OS X. In addition to this README, there are
comments in the scripts that provide some additional explanation for how they
work.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The scripts build digiKam with MacPorts, so you will need Xcode and the other
prerequisites for Macports. See http://www.macports.org/install.php for details.

You will also need to install Packages software from
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html
which does the actual packaging of the files needed to install digiKam.

HERE THERE BE DRAGONS
---------------------
Use these scripts at your own risk.  For example, both scripts contain
"rm -rf" (to clear previous builds) -- a mistake could wipe your drive. There
is little error checking or validation. I make no claims to be compentent at
coding or packaging, or to the suitability or saftety of the scripts or
software compiled/packaged using them.

COMPONENTS
----------
There are 4 scripts to be run by the user. 2 first ones installs
MacPorts and all dependencies, next one digiKam, and last one makes a
PKG binary installer for OSX.

SCRIPT DESCRIPTIONS
-------------------
All scripts should be run from within the digikam-package directory.

* 01-build-macports.sh:

This script downloads and configures a custom non-root install
of MacPorts to /opt/digikam. The PKG will install to the same place,
avoiding the confusion associated with relocation and install_name_tool. The
custom location, as opposed to /opt/local, should allow digiKam to co-exist
with a standard Macports installation

* 02-build-extralibs.sh:

This script configures, and compile a custom non-root install to /opt/digikam
of extra libraries, including KF5 frameworks, and most important photo management
libs used by digiKam as Exiv2 and LensFun.

* 03-build-digikam.sh:

This script configures, and compile a custom non-root install of digiKam to
/opt/digikam.

* 04-build-packages.sh:

Once you've successfully built digiKam, /opt/digikam may contain over 10GB of files.
The make-package.sh script grabs the ~500MB needed to run digiKam and showfoto,
and places them in ~/digikam-package/opt. These include applications documentations
and translations.

This script creates Applescript launch applications for the programs that will
be run by the user (digiKam, Showfoto, etc), and preinstall/postinstall
scripts in digikam-package/package.

The launcher applications:
     1) load dbus-session with launchctl if it isn't already loaded
     2) launch kded if it isn't already running and
     3) set "DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug" if the digikam port was built with  the
       +debug variant.

this script also create the pre-install and post-install scripts that are run
when the package is installed. They delete any pre-existing /opt/digikam,
delete and recreate /Applications/digiKam, and load dbus-system with launchctl.

Finally, this script sets the version number, and runs Packages to
put everything together.

* rll.py

Run by 04-build-packages.sh. It is a python script that takes a list of binaries
and libraries supplied by 04-build-packages.sh and recursively lists the dylibs on
which they depend, and their dependencies, etc.. Adapted with minimal
modification (mostly deleting stuff) from
https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/master/build/osx/otool.py.
