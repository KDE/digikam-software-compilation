Thank you for installing digiKam!

We would like to inform you that this port of digiKam under Windows is not as stable as the Linux version.

digiKam works mostly fine under Windows, but some features are still broken due to some bugs or not yet implemented features in the underlying KDE.org libraries.

To handle video files with digiKam under Windows, we need an extra and free video codec package, as <a href"http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm">KLite Codec Pack</a> for exemple.

To report a bug or a whish, please follow instructions at <a href="http://www.digikam.org/support">digiKam project web site</a>.

To know all current reports open about Windows release, please check the relevant <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=144974&amp;op_sys=MS%20Windows&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;product=digikam">the Bugzilla entries</a>.

<b>NOTE:</b> when a dysfunction is discovered please get a backtrace of debug statements generated by digiKam while running.
Not like under Linux, these information are printed on a system console only visible with a dedicated application named DebugView.
You can donwload this tool <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/debugview.aspx">at this url</a>.

Thanks in advance <a href="http://www.digikam.org/donation">for your support</a>.

The digiKam team
