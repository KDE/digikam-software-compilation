Thank you for installing digiKam!

We would like to inform you that this port of digiKam under windows
is not as stable as the linux version.

digiKam works mostly fine under windows, but some features are still broken
due to some bugs in the underlying KDE libraries.

For example, Camera auto detection doesn't work under windows.
