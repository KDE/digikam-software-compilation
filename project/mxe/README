DESCRIPTION
-----------
These files and scripts are used to make binary installer of the digiKam
Software Collection for Windows 32 bits or 64 bits. In addition to this README,
there are comments in the scripts that provide some additional explanation for
how they work.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The scripts build digiKam with MXE cross compiler, so you will need all dependencies
and the other prerequisites for MXE. See http://mxe.cc/#requirements for details.

You will also need to install NSIS software (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)
which does the actual packaging of the files needed to install digiKam.

COMPONENTS
----------
There are 4 scripts to be run by the user. 2 first ones installs
MXE and all dependencies, next one digiKam, and last one makes a 
binary installer for Windows.

SCRIPT DESCRIPTIONS
-------------------
All scripts should be run from within the digikam-package directory.

IMPORTANT: set properly the right architecture target in first : windows 32 or 64 bits.
Look in config.sh file for details.

* 01-build-mxe.sh:

This script downloads and configures a custom install
of MXE to ./build.

* 02-build-extralibs.sh:

This script configures, and compile a install to ./build
of extra libraries, including KF5 frameworks, and most important photo management
libs used by digiKam as Exiv2 and LensFun.

* 03-build-digikam.sh:

This script configures, and compile a custom install of digiKam to ./build.

* 04-build-installer.sh:

Once you've successfully built digiKam, ./build may contain over 4GB of files.
The make-installer.sh script grabs the ~200MB needed to run digiKam and showfoto.
These include applications documentations and translations.

This script creates Windows application links for the programs that will
be run by the user (digiKam, Showfoto, etc). It use makensis CLI tool from NSIS 
application dedicated to build Windows installer. This one is available for Linux
as Mingw package.

* rll.py

Run by 04-build-installer.sh. It is a python script that takes a list of binaries
and libraries supplied by 04-build-installer.sh and recursively lists the dlls on
which they depend, and their dependencies, etc...
