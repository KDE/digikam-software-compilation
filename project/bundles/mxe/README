RESUME
------
This scripts build a binary digiKam installer for Windows under Linux using cross-compiler
environnement MXE and NSIS application.

This script follow instructions from Qt bundle deployement for Windows as shared libraries
available at this url: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html

DESCRIPTION
-----------
These files and scripts are used to make binary installer of the digiKam
Software Collection for Windows 32 bits or 64 bits. In addition to this README,
there are comments in the scripts that provide some additional explanations for
how they work.

Note : these cross-compiling scripts exists because the way provided by KDE team to compile 
a KDE application under Windows with MSVC compiler through emerge tool never work and is just
a big pain to use/configure/run with a Windows OS. Also KDE Windows initiative look like 
unmaintained/inactive since a while.
Another big advantage of cross-compiling is to not require a Windows to do the job, which 
is definitively a weird operating system to compile and hack.

BUNDLE CONTENTS
---------------

Note : the bundle is rellocable.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The scripts build digiKam with MXE cross compiler, so you will need all dependencies
and the other pre-requisites first for MXE.
See http://mxe.cc/#requirements for details.

IMPORTANT:
- You must set the right target architecture : windows 32 or 64 bits.
- You must set the digiKam git tags to checkout right source code in installer.
- You must set the option to host debug symbols or not in installer.
Look in config.sh file for details.

COMPONENTS
----------
There are 4 scripts to be run by the user. 2 first ones installs
MXE and all dependencies, next one digiKam, and last one makes a 
binary installer for Windows.

SCRIPT DESCRIPTIONS
-------------------
All scripts should be run from within this directory.

* 01-build-mxe.sh:

This script downloads and configures a custom install
of MXE to ./build.

* 02-build-extralibs.sh:

This script configures, and compile a install to ./build
of extra libraries, including KF5 frameworks, and most important photo management
libs used by digiKam as Exiv2 and LensFun.

* 03-build-digikam.sh:

This script configures, and compile a custom install of digiKam to ./build.

* 04-build-installer.sh:

Once you've successfully built digiKam, ./build may contain over 4GB of files.
The make-installer.sh script grabs the ~200MB needed to run digiKam and showfoto.
These include applications documentations and translations.

This script creates Windows application links for the programs that will
be run by the user (digiKam and Showfoto). It use makensis CLI tool from NSIS
application dedicated to build Windows installer. This one is available for Linux
as Mingw package. The version >= 3 is required to be compatible with Windows 10.

Depending of configuration done in config.sh, this script is able to upload automatically
the bundle file on files.kde.org digiKam area through ssh. A valid ssh key configured
with remote KDE server need to be set previously with the account. You can load ssh key
at startup following instruction give at this url:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90853/how-can-i-run-ssh-add-automatically-without-password-prompt

* rll.py

Run by 04-build-installer.sh. It is a python script that takes a list of binaries
and libraries supplied by 04-build-installer.sh and recursively lists the dlls on
which they depend, and their dependencies, etc...
Adapted with minimal modification (mostly deleting stuff) from
https://github.com/mpreisler/mingw-bundledlls

* makeall.sh

This script permit to build whole 32 and 64 bits installers from scratch at the same time.

* update.sh

This script re-build only digiKam and installers in 32 and 64 bits.
